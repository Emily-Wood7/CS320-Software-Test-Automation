**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

I can start by reviewing the requirements then creating pseudocode and/or a flowchart.  I can make sure that input is validated.  I can have a peer review my code to ensure it is functional.  A peer can also look at my code to make sure it is clean and legible.  I can also create tests that will ensure my program will do what is required and limit unauthorize usage.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

I can view the needs as a checklist and use them when creating code.  First the requirements can be incorporated into the program through comments such as "#The program should do this."  Then under my comments I can create method or function stubs to get started with "#TO DO"s to come back to later.  From there I can work in pieces to ensure each requirement (or as I see it, a checklist) is ticked off my list and completed. 

**How do I approach designing software?**

First, I determine through the user what the software needs to do.  Then I design the pieces I want within the software through flowcharts or pseudocode.  Then I create comments within my code that include each requirement.  I then create method or function stubs and write the code within those stubs one at a time.  In this case, we also created unit tests and I designed my unit tests so all possible forms of input were tested and my code coverage was 100%.

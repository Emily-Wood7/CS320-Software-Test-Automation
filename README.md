How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I can start by reviewing the requirements then creating pseudocode and/or a flowchart.  I can make sure that input is validated.  I can also create tests that will ensure my program will do what is required and limit unauthorize usage.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I can view the needs as a checklist and use them when creating code.  It can start as a comment, then a stub, then finally code.

How do I approach designing software?

First, I determine through the user what the software needs to do.  Then I design the pieces I want within the software through flowcharts or pseudocode.  Then I create comments within my code that include each requirement.  I then create method or function stubs and write the code within those stubs one at a time.  In this case, we also created unit tests and I designed my unit tests so all possible forms of input were tested and my code coverage was 100%.
